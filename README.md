Easiest way is to use a release [binaries](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-env/releases)

#### From source
Set up deps, you need to have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
```shell
make install_deps
```

### Usage
Run 
```
export CHAINLINK_IMAGE="public.ecr.aws/chainlink/chainlink"

export CHAINLINK_ENV_USER="Satoshi"
chainlink-env
```

# Develop
#### Running standalone example environment
```shell
go run examples/simple/env.go

If you have another env of that type, you can connect by overriding environment name
```
ENV_NAMESPACE="..."  go run examples/chainlink/env.go
```
